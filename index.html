            <h3>Junior Full Stack Developer </h3>
            <p>The processes involved in the development of a software application mainly fall into two categories:
                front-end
                development and back-end development. </p>
            <p>Front-end development takes care of the client’s side of the application; a front-end developer makes
                sure the
                end product is visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>
            <p>Back-end development powers the server-side of the application; a back-end developer is responsible for
                using the
                programming language to exchange information between the browser and back-end databases.</p>
            <p>Full stack development refers to the development of both the front-end and back-end of a web application
                or
                website. Now, what does full stack mean? A software stack is the collection of multiple components in a
                software
                application that works together to ensure the application’s smooth running. This includes software
                products,
                patches, coding frameworks, servers, operating systems, database tools, and so on. To facilitate user
                interaction, to run calculations, and to power back-end functions, these components are on top of the
                other: a
                “full stack.” </p>

            <h1><span class="orange-color">Backend Development</span></h1>
            <p><b>Python</b>
                If you’re going to be a back end developer, you need to develop your Python skills. While it has nothing
                to do with the snake that inspired its name, Python is one of the premier languages used in development
                today. In 2019, a study conducted by Stack Overflow deemed Python the “fastest-growing major programming
                language” in the world above Java, and second only to Rust in likeability rankings. A full 41.7 percent
                of the report’s 90,000 respondents said that they used Python in 2018.</p>
            <p><b>Java</b>
                First, let’s get one thing out of the way: Java is not JavaScript. While the two have similar names —
                and did, during the Netscape era, briefly intersect — they are incredibly different. In fact, to borrow
                a quote from tech journalist David Diehl, “The evolution of the two languages took such wildly different
                paths from [Netscape] that the common joke is that Java is to JavaScript as ham is to a hamster.</p>
            <p><b>PHP</b>
                PHP, or Hypertext Preprocessor, is one of the most common and usable server-side languages in the
                development sector. Unlike Python or Java, PHP is a scripting language, which means that it interprets
                scripts — i.e., programming instructions — at runtime to automate routine processes or improve
                performance for an application.</p>
            <p><b>SQL</b>
                Technology might get outmoded quickly, but SQL seems to be an exception to the rule. Since being ruled
                an industry-standard language by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, SQL, or
                Structured Query Language, has empowered back end developers to access and manipulate relational
                databases as needed. SQL allows programmers to insert and delete records easily, file queries against a
                database, create new tables and store procedures in a database, and even establish permissions on those
                tables and procedures. If you ever need to deal with relational databases — and if you’re a back end
                developer, there’s little doubt that you will — you need to know SQL.</p>
            <p><b>Git</b>
                If you’re looking for a widely used modern version control system to fit your needs, Git is a great
                option. It is actively maintained and open-sourced, created by the same founder of the Linux operating
                system. Each developer with a working copy of the code can easily access the full history of what
                changes have been made, making it easy to edit and restore the code. Among any back end developer skills
                list, Git is one of the most high-performing, flexible, and secure.</p>
            <p><b>Communication</b>
                While there are many technical skills a back end developer needs, there are some useful non-technical
                ones as well, and communication ranks high on that list. Establishing well-honed communication skills
                means you’ll find it easier to collaborate, whether with other back end developers or with the front end
                developers who are working on the same projects. Being able to communicate clearly also helps when
                working with business leaders and other professionals who do not have the same background in development
                and programming.</p>
